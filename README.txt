Welcome to Information & Control System by Benjamin J Cullen.


1. Run install.sh (installs dependencies).
2. In the same directory as Information-Control-System.py run, python3.5 Information-Control-System.py

3. Command List:
For information say: 'search wikipedia +anything you like'
For definition say: 'define +anything you like'
For control say the name of any .py file in Plugins directory.

Information:
A Wikipedia web crawler
A Wikipedia define web crawler
For more information crawl more websites/databases or make information locally available manually.
To handle more information:
Say 'latest transcription for +anything you like'.
Say 'list available transcriptions for +anything you like'.
Say 'transcription +anything you like'.
In this way, we can web crawl automatically too, daily crawling to harvest information that we
can search for and access. So build crawlers for information your interested in :D
This is a framework algorithm. Make web crawlers, the algorithmic framework does the rest.

Control:
Any .py file in plugins directory.
In this way, we can control anything we code for, the framework handles the rest.
Just put your code in plugins directory and speak its file name.
This is a framework algorithm. Make command files, the algorithmic framework does the rest.

Symbiot:
If you dont want Google to constantly listen then you might find the Symbiot 'remote' helpful.
This way, we can turn speech recognition and and off with our droid in and around the home.

Requirements:
Software:
	python3.5
	Built on: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS	
Hardware:
	Mic/Headset (preferably wireless)
	Works best with speakers connected around the home, a wireless headset & Symbiot.
